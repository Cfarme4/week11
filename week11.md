# Week 11 Outline

## The logic of object-oriented programming

- The point of OOP is to be able to bundle data and functions into logical units.
- When this is done well, it makes our code much easier to read and use.
- Baseball stats example
  - Since the World Series was just on, we can use a baseball example as motivation.
  - A huge number of statistics and outcomes are recorded each game.
  - Imagine that we want to write a program that will allow us to easily access relevant information quickly.
  - This is the kind of code that sports stats companies use to come up with those fascinating bits of information on the fly during the game.
    - "The last time a player hit two doubles followed by a triple after breaking his bat was on Monday, Aug. 12, 1983."
  - Let's think about some of the statisitics that are kept: who played, what's the outcome of each at bat, how many errors and who committed them, what happened each pitch (ball, strike, foul, etc.), ...
  - Now, imagine keeping track of all this as "loose" data. We might have a list of names, a list of what happened each at bat, a list of errors, etc.
  - If the data were stored this way and we wanted to know something like, "Who committed the last error and how did they do their last at bat?", it would be a nightmare. We'd have to first go to our list of players committing errors, then figure out what order they batted in the lineup, what order was batting currently, and somehow work backwards through the list of at bats to figure out what they did.
  - WAIT! There's a better way. If we use OOP, we could have created a player object that would automatically store all the relevant information on a player. As soon as we had their name, we could pull up any relevant statistic. We could even come up with new functions to summarize the statistics for each player in any way we wanted.


## Demography Simulation

- We'll start this week by continuing to work through our example of demography simulation on a landscape.
- This will allow us to see a moderately sophisticated program built with OOP from the ground up.

(self.nRows=5,nColumns=5): gives us a default of our landscape
every row is a list
Landscape [
          [cell1,cell2.cell3,cell4,cell5] #row 1
          so scrpit should spit out a list of 5 row all containing 5 digits from 0-24(5 rcolums 5 row each)
          Sel. sections[][] gives you the the entry inside the list by what number is inside of the bracet ex sel.sections[0] get the first entry in the list
